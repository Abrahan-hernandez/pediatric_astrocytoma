## Presentations

In this directory, you will find two presentations that I gave in the Bioinformatic's workshop at CONABIO. 

* **lighting talk.pdf** 

A quick overview of my Masters's project. Especially, from the bioinformatic's part. 

* **GSEA_compressed** 

A methodologic presentation about Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) witch is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes).
