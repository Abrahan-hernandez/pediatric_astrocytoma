## Readme_FastQC 

As you probably know, _Github_ does not allow HTML files. So, even though in your computer you can use the **REPORTS** file to storage your HTML outputs for the QC's (CHECK the [FastQC](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/blob/master/bin/1.%20FastQC.sh) script) you can check the QC reports in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nPWKf84DlnuEdMNPXBBYsNzAGnilT0Ib) Drive file.

Inside you will find the results for 42 Fastq [FILES](https://osf.io/spmrq/). (2 for each sample, since they are pair-end samples). 

In this [page](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) you can check what is the meaning of each of the parameters that are measured in the QC test. 

The quality score is based on the [Phred Score](https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_Q-Scores.pdf)
