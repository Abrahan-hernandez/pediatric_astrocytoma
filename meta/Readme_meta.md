# Code-key Readme

In this readme, you will find a "code-key" that will help you understand the meaning of each metadata category. 
As you can see in this directory you will find a .csv file that contains the necessary metadata for the multi-group comparisons. 
Also, you will find a pdf file for visualization-only. 

### Sample 
In this column, you will find the names of the samples that I'm working with and whose fastq files can be found on my OSF 
[page](https://osf.io/spmrq/?view_only=dfd16c89a6474e9f8a0299de1bbcde0a.) 

>For the prefixes:

* **A.-**  Stands for
* **CM.-**  Stands for 
* **M.-**  Stands for


### Histopathologic_group

Here you can find which group belongs to each sample. According to the 2007 WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System
That is based on histopathologic features. Were **I** is the lowest grade and **IV** the highest for astrocytomas. 
You can find more information about this classification in this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1929165/).

For the controls, you will find samples as "Control" which are samples taken far away from the tumor. 
> Example: If the tumor was found on the cerebellum the control is taken from the brain and _viceversa_.

You will also find "ControlC" that stands for Control contiguous. Those are samples taken from the adjacent tissue of the tumor.
