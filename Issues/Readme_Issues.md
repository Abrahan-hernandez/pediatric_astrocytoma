# Readme Issues

## Directory with mock files and images for the issues presented in class. 

You will find small files, that can serve as examples of the kind of data that I am currently working with. 

### First issue 

I presented an issue, asking for help to create a loop in bash for the fastq alignment in [STAR](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/blob/master/bin/3.%20STAR.sh).

Issue: [Loop for alignment ](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/issues/2#issue-488293528)

To achieve this, we used the [Mock Fastq Files](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/tree/master/Issues/Mock%20Fastq%20Files) to run a "mock" alignment with STAR and see if the loop worked.


### Second issue 

I needed help to identify the genes that are shared in each of the tables, by searching using the gene labels (gene ID) for the genes that are present in all the tables.

Issue: [Choose by gene labels](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/issues/5)

To resolve this problem, we used the following [tables](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/tree/master/Issues/Tables)

Also, I uploaded the needed [libraries](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/blob/master/Issues/Needed%20libraries.R) to run the [script](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/blob/master/bin/7.%20edgeR/DE.R) from where I obtained the tables of the differentially expressed genes, to see if the problem was from the script. 


### Third issue 

This issue was more conceptual, by defining the contrasts to find the DE genes that correspond to a single histopathological category, in other words:

The Genes that are specifical to each category.

Issue: [Define contrasts for DE](https://github.com/FernandaDiaz12/pediatric_astrocytoma/issues/6)

For this issue I didn't upload any extra files to make mock runs.
